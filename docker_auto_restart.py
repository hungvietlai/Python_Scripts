"""
This Python script is designed for Docker container management, monitoring and automatically restarting any containers that are not in a running state.
It iterates over all containers managed by the local Docker daemon, checks their status, and restarts those that aren't actively running.
The script logs its operations, including restart attempts and any errors encountered, to a specified log file.
